# My personal build of [suckless terminal](https://st.suckless.org/)

Includes patches:
  + [alpha](https://st.suckless.org/patches/alpha/) for opacity
  + [anysize](https://st.suckless.org/patches/anysize/) for proper resizing
  + [externalpipe](https://st.suckless.org/patches/externalpipe/) with configured dmenu link opener (obviously requies dmenu installed)
  + [iso14755](https://st.suckless.org/patches/iso14755/) to paste unicode glyphs
  + [scrollback](https://st.suckless.org/patches/scrollback/) to scrollback through output history (history size set to 2000)
  + Configured with my favorite [material theme](https://github.com/kaicataldo/material.vim)
